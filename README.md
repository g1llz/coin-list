# Coinlist (work in progress)

> The easiest whitelist for cryptocurrencies (chrome extension)


### v 0.1

- Cannot choose other cryptos (BTC, ETH and EGLD are default)
- The extension shows the cryptocurrency variation for 24 hours and 7 days
- The layout is too square and should be improved soon (or not)

### Dev mode

You can run this extension in **"development mode"** in Chrome.

1 - Run `npm run build` on terminal

2 - Open the Chrome, enable *"develop mode"*

3 - Click on *"load unpacked"* and select the folder *"dist"* into the project

4 - Booom! That's it.
